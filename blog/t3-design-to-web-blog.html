        <h2>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h2>

         <p>
            A responsive site is when a page can be opened on multiple devices and be automaticly
            resized to the screen size. It's important as now adays many people will have 
            different types of devices where they would access sites such as iphones,tablets, and computers.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h3>

        <p>
            Mobile first design is the first actual design for the small screen mobile 
        </p>

        <h4>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons</h4>

        <p>
            Framework is where a structure is given to you where you can code of from.
             Such as basic code within a file where you would add data into where it would
            simpfy the process. Therefore you can focus on the bigger parts of the project.
            Pros - Don't have to start from scratch, reuseable 
            Cons - Some frameworks can't be modified.

        <h5>What a wireframe is and why we use it</h5>

        <p>
            Wireframe is a sketch of your page layout such as a webpage but by only using
            simple lines (wires). We use it so that we can get a basic draft idea down of our plan.        
        </p>

        <h5>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why ?</h5>

        <p>
            I believe the most difficult part would be places the blog images correctly, as you can see here it isn't fully complete as I feel like I am
            spending too much time on this and better to move on for now and come back later.
            Process over product is what I feel for this sprint, I was more focused on getting a working basic site before I do flashy things.
            Another hard part was trying to figure out puting the right padding for the images, I did get it done but it didn't seem right therefore I switched back to a simple
            colour background.
