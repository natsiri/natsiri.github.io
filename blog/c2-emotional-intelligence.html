    <h1> What learnings did you take from the chapter ?</h1>
    <p>
      With the right training, anyone can become more Emotionally intelligent.
      Emotional Intelligence matters much more than IQ.
      Emotional intelligence enables three important skills. Work performance,
      leadership, and the ability to create conditions for happiness.
      The things that lead to build Emotional intelligence will also help
      us create conditions for our own happiness.
      Response flexibility - the ability to pause before you act.
      Improving our ability to regulate our attention can significantly impact
      how we respond to emotions.
      Affect labeling - labeling feelings therefor it helps to manage that emotion.

    <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness ?</h2>
    <p>
      I found this to be a very important lesson for myself as once I gave myself
      two minutes of mindfulness from switching from easy to easier. I had a clearer
      mind and can see that in doing this it would greatly improve my Emotional intelligent.
