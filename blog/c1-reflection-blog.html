    <h1>My Personal EDA experience so far</h1>
    
    <p>
       My take on DBC/EDA experience is that this boot camp is not to be looked at as a package but more than that. My impression is that EDA is going to be an intensive
      camp where I we will be hitting the floor running, coding from the first day as such.
      I believe that I will engage this type of culture with an open mind, with the willingness to grow from what I will learn during the weeks.
      Only slightly has my expectations of EDA changed as I knew this is how the course would be built around. It's not a normal course but a special one where
      we will learn much more than just code compared to university.

      Yes I am excited to participate and I am afraid.. I'm afraid of what my true potential will be and if I can work with the teachers and mentors to unlock them
