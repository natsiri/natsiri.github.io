    <h1>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h1>

    <p>
        Very complex but interesting, both with it's own style and structure.

    <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.
    </h2>

    <p>
        Control flow is the process by which decisions and actions are carried out in the code, and in what order.
        You wouldn’t brush your teeth before waking up in the morning. You would also keep brushing, until each tooth has been brushed.
        Control statements determine the control and flow of processes the code is calling.
    </p>

    <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>

    <p>     
         Accessing data from arrays is used  with square brackets such as myTest[1] You would use this to access a certain position within the array.
         Accessing data from object literals is done by using dot notation: for an myObject {“cat”: “dog”}, you could use myObject.cat which then returns dog
    </p>

    <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>

    <p>
        Functions are scripts that are used in codes where we can reuse overtime to exucute a input which may be complicated or simple.
