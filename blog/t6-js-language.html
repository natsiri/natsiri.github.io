    <h2>Parentheses ( )</h2>
    <p>Parentheses are used commonly in coding and they are used to contain a list of
        parameters passed to functions and control strutures. In some cases there may 
        be no parameters and the Parentheses are left blank like so ()
    </p>
    <h3>Brackets [ ]</h3>
    <p>Brackets are used in what we call Arrays which is used to store a large amount of data such as exampleArray[1,2,3,4,5]
        this is not limited to numbers but can have many other types such as Strings.
    </p>
    <h4>Braces { }</h4>
    <p>Braces are used in JavaScript also very commonly as it is used to create objects.</p>
    <h5>Single quotes ' ' and Double quotes " "</h5>
    <p>Both single and double quotes are used in JavaScript to write a String such as so "String test" or 'String test2' both can be used 
        as it results are the same but is best to keep the code clean by using 1 type consisitly </p>
