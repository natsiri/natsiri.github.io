    <h1>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h1>
    <p>1. Got blocked on a simple problem</p>
    <p>2. Solved a problem in a elegant way</p>

    <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
    <p>The simple problem was that the code seemed perfectly corrected with no errors, yet it isn't working.</p>

    <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
    <p>I reviewed and read over all the code and found out that it was either a simple spelling or a simple } bracket</p>

    <h4>How did you feel throughout the process?</h4>
    <p>A little bit confused but I knew that it would be a small issue that would be found and fixed</p>

    <h5>What did you learn?</h5>
    <p>Nothing is ever perfect and that you will make mistakes. You learn from your mistakes.</p>

    <h6>Reflect on how confident you feel using problem solving techniques</h6>
    <p>Reading error messages - Always the first option and usually I would see where the problem is</p>
    <p>Trying something - Naturally it would come after reading the error message and sometimes it works</p>
    <p>Googling - stackoverflow usually comes up and is most helpful when I am lost</p>
    <p>Asking coaches for help - At this moment of time I don't feel confident in asking the tutors for help at all</p>
