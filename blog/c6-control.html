    <h1>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h1>
    <p>Personally for myself, I have a lot on my plate and family is a big one for me. The thought of how much
        this course actually means for myself and my family brings disproportionate emotional response.

    <h2>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h2>
    <p>I found SBNRR to be very familar, I have used this techique before as my sisters have thought me to do so when I was 
        under a lot of stress and discomfort. From my experience, this is very effective and I find it helpful in most cases.
