    <h1>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h1>
    <p>It was really different for myself as I tend to keep to myself but I did find it interesting and many ways. When you really do 
        focus and listen with a open mind you hear not just words but emotions. They found it to be a positive thing to be teaching in the boot camp.
    </p>

    <p> Having a partner to practice and build a relationship with, such as family. One mindfullness breath a day also.</p>
