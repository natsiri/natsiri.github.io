    <h1>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h1>
    <p>They are an same apple from the same tree, self-awareness is .. mindfulness </p>

    <h2>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h2>
    <p>I first tried Body Scan, from the 6 broken down sections it was different as I don't have a great back I feel pain. I can see how this would help though.</p>
