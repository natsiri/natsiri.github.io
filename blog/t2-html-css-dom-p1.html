    <p>
      Designs and structural features that interests me from CSS Zen Garden were
      the simplicity of the useage of block design. It wasn't overwhelming
      to read nor was it for the eye.
      The site that I reviewd was https://boilermakerhouse.com.au/ This sites
      structural feature that I would like to use would be the bacckground image slide which
      plays while on the page.

    <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you
    describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>

    <p>
      HTML is the written text/content on a page, while CSS is the design of the page
      where images and layouts/colours can be coded in. DOM is the storyboard of the whole
      website.

    <h3>What is the box model ?</h3>

    <p>
      Box model is the design and layout of a webpage, where there is images or text
      there will be a box around the content.
    </p>

    <h3>What is meant by boxifying design</h3>

    <p>
      Boxifying design comes from websites general structure of everything being a box.
      Where there is a group of text and pictures there will be a box around that content.
