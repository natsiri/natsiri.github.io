    <p>A habit technique that I tried and am very interested in is
      to display my ability first, prove it to myself then believe in my ability to push forward.
      What has worked for me is giving myself less time. The more time I have the more I
      side track or find a way to side track my productivity. Therefore when I give myself
      a deadline or less time to do something I find it to work.
      I want to experiment on being able to get really good at something and then building
      confidence from the skill that I know.
